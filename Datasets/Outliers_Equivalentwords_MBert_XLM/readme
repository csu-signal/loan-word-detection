This file contains outliers calculated using z-scores for cosine similarities using bth XLM and M-BERT cross-lingual models. Outliers from both high cosine sim and low cosine sim are captured as csv files. 
Cos similarities are calculated using embeddings from the first token of the text pairs(L1,L2) as it if often used as the CLS or classification token.
