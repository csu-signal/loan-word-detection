This is the train-test split with labels for our logistic regression classifier related experiments. For training the classifier, we need the semantic similarities from Mbert(or XLM or ParsBERT) for 
each of these word pairs(l1,l2) and the logits from the neural networks(CNNS, DNNs) as features only since the train/test splits already have the various normalized edit distances. 

train.shape, test.shape : ((4400, 11), (503, 11))
Train split:((1200, 11): loan words 
 
 (1200, 11): Equivalent words/synonyms 
 
 (1200, 11): Random shuffled words 
 
 (800, 11): Hard Negatives 
 
 Test split respectively:
 
 (143, 11),
 
 (140, 11),
 
 (140, 11),
 
 (80, 11))
